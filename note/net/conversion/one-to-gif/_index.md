File represented by .ONE extension are created by Microsoft OneNote application. OneNote lets you gather information using the application as if you are using your draftpad for taking notes. OneNote files can contain different elements that can be placed at non-fixed locations on document pages. These elements may contain text, digitized handwriting, and objects copied from other applications including images, drawings and multimedia (audio/video) clips. Microsoft now offers online version of OneNote as part of Office365 where Notes can be shared with other OneNote users over the internet.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
