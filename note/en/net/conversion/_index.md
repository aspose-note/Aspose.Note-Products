It acts as standalone and user-friendly, developers can easily integrate it for transforming .one extension files to the desired format like PDF and BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG or TIFF image formats.

Just like PDF conversion, process of converting Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> OneNote to image formats is almost same. That is loading the OneNote file and calling the Save method, providing the relevant image and SaveFormat.Imageformat as parameters. Other than desktop software applications, it is also easy to integrate within webbased applications for browser based **one to image conversion** solutions.
