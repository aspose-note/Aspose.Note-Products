Those who have worked with Microsoft OneNote application may have noticed the presence of .onetoc2 files in the notebook folder. Microsoft OneNote creates binary .onetoc2 file as Table of Contents for keeping an index about the ordering of different note-taking sections in a notebook. A notebook is a collection of section files that are stored in the same directory. The .onetoc2 file uses a collection of properties to specify settings such as order of sections within the notebook and the color of the notebook.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="bmp" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}
Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
