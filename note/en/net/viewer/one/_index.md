File represented by .ONE extension are created by Microsoft OneNote application. OneNote lets you gather information using the application as if you are using your draftpad for taking notes. OneNote files can contain different elements that can be placed at non-fixed locations on document pages. These elements may contain text, digitized handwriting, and objects copied from other applications including images, drawings and multimedia (audio/video) clips. Microsoft now offers online version of OneNote as part of Office365 where Notes can be shared with other OneNote users over the internet.
